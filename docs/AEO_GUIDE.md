# Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) Guide

## Overview

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) prepares your website for AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overview. This guide explains how the Lowther website is optimized for these platforms.

---

## What is AEO?

AEO differs from traditional SEO by focusing on:
- **Direct answers** rather than rankings
- **Structured data** that AI can easily parse
- **Clear semantic markup** for context
- **Natural language** that AI can understand and cite
- **Comprehensive information** in digestible formats

---

## Current AEO Implementation

### 1. **Structured Data (JSON-LD)**

We implement multiple schema types recognized by AI engines:

#### Organization Schema
Located in `/src/app/layout.tsx` - tells AI about your company:

```typescript
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Lowther Loudspeakers",
  "foundingDate": "1932",
  "address": {...},
  "contactPoint": {...},
  "sameAs": [...]
}
```

**Why it matters**: AI engines use this to answer questions like "Who makes Lowther speakers?" or "How old is Lowther?"

#### WebSite Schema with Sitelinks
Located in `/src/app/layout.tsx` - enables search functionality:

```typescript
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebSite",
  "potentialAction": {
    "@type": "SearchAction",
    "target": "{search_term_string}"
  }
}
```

**Why it matters**: Google displays sitelinks in search results, helping users find specific pages directly.

#### BreadcrumbList Schema
Auto-generated by `/src/components/breadcrumbs.tsx`:

```typescript
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [...]
}
```

**Why it matters**: Helps AI understand site structure and page hierarchy for better context in answers.

#### Product Schema
Use for loudspeakers, drive units, and products:

```typescript
const schema = generateStructuredData('Product', {
  name: 'Philharmonic III',
  description: '...',
  images: [...],
  price: '8995.00',
  currency: 'GBP',
  inStock: true,
});
```

**Why it matters**: AI can cite specific product details, prices, and availability.

#### Article Schema
Use for blog posts and editorial content:

```typescript
const schema = generateStructuredData('Article', {
  title: 'Building the Perfect Horn',
  description: '...',
  author: 'Lowther Team',
  publishedTime: '2024-01-15',
});
```

**Why it matters**: AI attributes quotes and information to your articles correctly.

## 2. **Semantic HTML Structure**

### Page Structure Best Practices

```tsx
<main>
  <article>
    <header>
      <h1>Main Page Title</h1>
      <p>Introduction paragraph</p>
    </header>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Key Topic</h2>
      <p>Content about topic...</p>
    </section>
    
    <aside>
      <h3>Related Information</h3>
    </aside>
  </article>
</main>
```

**Why it matters**: Semantic HTML helps AI understand content hierarchy and relationships.

---

## 3. **Metadata Optimization**

Every page should have comprehensive metadata via `generateSEOMetadata()`:

```typescript
import { generateSEOMetadata } from "@/lib/seo";
import { getPageMetadata } from "@/lib/metadata-config";

const pageMetadata = getPageMetadata("page-path");

export const metadata = generateSEOMetadata({
  title: pageMetadata.title,
  description: pageMetadata.description,
  keywords: pageMetadata.keywords,
  image: pageMetadata.ogImage,
  url: "/page-path",
});
```

### Metadata Components

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive (50-60 characters)
2. **Description**: Comprehensive summary (150-160 characters)
3. **Keywords**: Relevant terms for context
4. **OG Image**: Visual preview (1200x630px)

---

## 4. **Content Optimization for AI**

### Writing for AI Engines

#### ✅ DO:
- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Write in natural language
- Include specific facts and figures
- Define technical terms
- Use structured lists for processes
- Answer common questions directly

#### ❌ DON'T:
- Use vague or marketing-heavy language
- Hide information in images
- Use excessive jargon without explanation
- Create thin content pages
- Duplicate content across pages

### Example: Good AEO Content

```markdown
## What Makes Lowther Drive Units Special?

Lowther drive units are full-range speakers featuring:

1. **Single Driver Design**: No crossover networks needed
2. **High Efficiency**: 94-100dB sensitivity
3. **Handcrafted Quality**: Made in Britain since 1932
4. **Premium Materials**: AlNiCo or Neodymium magnets

This design eliminates phase issues common in multi-driver systems.
```

**Why it's good**: Direct answer, structured format, specific details, clear benefits.

---

## 5. **FAQ Schema (Optional)**

For pages with common questions, add FAQ schema:

```typescript
const faqSchema = generateStructuredData('FAQPage', {
  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How long does it take to build a Quarter Wave?',
      answer: 'Most builders complete the Quarter Wave in 40-60 hours over 2-4 weeks...'
    },
    {
      question: 'What tools do I need?',
      answer: 'Basic woodworking tools including: table saw, router, drill press...'
    }
  ]
});
```

Add to page:
```tsx
<script
  type="application/ld+json"
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(faqSchema) }}
/>
```

---

## 6. **ItemList Schema**

For collection pages (drive units, speakers, etc.):

```typescript
const collectionSchema = generateStructuredData('ItemList', {
  items: [
    {
      name: 'DX3 Drive Unit',
      url: '/drive-units/dx3',
      image: '/images/drive-units/dx3.jpg'
    },
    // ... more items
  ]
});
```

**Why it matters**: AI can list your products accurately when asked "What speakers does Lowther make?"

---

## Testing Your AEO

### 1. **Structured Data Validation**

Test with Google's Rich Results Test:
```
https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
```

Paste your live URL and check for errors.

### 2. **AI Search Testing**

Ask AI engines directly:
- "What loudspeakers does Lowther make?"
- "How old is Lowther Loudspeakers?"
- "What is a Quarter Wave speaker?"
- "Where can I buy Lowther speakers?"

Check if they cite your website correctly.

### 3. **Schema.org Validator**

Validate your structured data:
```

```

## Advanced AEO Strategies

<span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person">
  <span itemprop="name">Paul Voigt</span>
</span>
founded Lowther in
<span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Date">
  <time itemprop="date" datetime="1932">1932</time>
</span>
```

### 2. **Video Schema**

For product videos or tutorials:

```typescript
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "VideoObject",
  "name": "Building the Quarter Wave",
  "description": "...",
  "thumbnailUrl": "...",
  "uploadDate": "2024-01-15",
  "duration": "PT12M30S"
}
```

### 3. **Review Schema**

For testimonials and reviews:

```typescript
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Review",
  "itemReviewed": {
    "@type": "Product",
    "name": "Philharmonic III"
  },
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "James Richardson"
  },
  "reviewRating": {
    "@type": "Rating",
    "ratingValue": 5
  }
}
```

## Monitoring AEO Performance

### Tools to Track

1. **Google Search Console**
   - Monitor featured snippets
   - Check rich result performance
   - Track sitelinks

2. **AI Search Mentions**
   - Use tools like BrandWell or SimilarWeb
   - Search for your brand in ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity
   - Track when AI cites your content

3. **User Feedback**
   - Ask customers how they found you
   - Monitor "How did you hear about us?" responses
   - Track referrals from AI platforms

---

## Common AEO Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Over-Optimization**
Don't stuff keywords unnaturally. AI detects and deprioritizes this.

### 2. **Thin Content**
Pages with <300 words are rarely cited by AI. Provide depth.

### 3. **Technical Errors**
Invalid structured data can hurt AI understanding. Validate regularly.

### 4. **Ignoring Mobile**
AI engines prioritize mobile-friendly content.

### 5. **Missing Context**
Don't assume AI knows your industry jargon. Define terms.
